            <p>Description: Empty String that becomes the contents of the content div.</p>
            <p>
                Endpoint to dynamically update the main content div on the webpage. 
                Dynamically updates it to nothing. It returns an empty div thus essentially removing whatever was in the main content div on the webpage. 
                Used so that the page isn't cluttered with old data and the newly appeared contact form.
