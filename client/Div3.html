        <p><span class = "first">D</span>HL flight 611 took off from Bahrain heading to Brusells and Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2973 from Moscow to Barcelona.
           It would be unfortunate mistake that the fate of these two flights intertwined in Germain airspace over Ãœberlingen. The collision killed all members of both flights reaching a total of 71 lives lost, thankfull DHL is a cargo shipping company and thus was not carrying as many passengers as commercial airlines.
          The two flights were heading towards each other, one needed to move. Flight 611 followed their traffic collision avoidance system, TCAS for short and began to descend. However, Flight 2973 folled instructions from ATC ignoring their TCAS and also began to descend. At the time there was only one air traffic controller on duty as his co-worker had taken a coffee break. Truly unfortuntate.</p>

        <h2>How it affected the airline industry</h2>
        <p>There wasn't as much of an effect as other crashes however it did serve as a not so gentle reminder that in the Aviation industry, mistakes or complacency leads to the loss of life.</p>
