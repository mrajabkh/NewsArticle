        <p><span class = "first">A</span>ir Canada 797, a DC-9 carring 46 people flying at 33,000 feet on what was supposed to be a routine flight from Dallas to Toronto on June 2nd 1983 till things turned awry.
           First signs of trouble were when wisps of smoke slithered out the rear lavatory which soon turned into black smoke that started to fill the cabin.
           The plane had to begin its emergency descent but things were getting tough for the pilot who was struggling to see the measurements on his instruments due to the smoke.
           Thankfully, skilled as he is he still managed to make the landing in Cincinatti. Unfortunately, the opening of the cabin doors caused a flashfire in which 23 lives were lost and
           the origin of the fire could not be determmined due to the flashover.

        <h2>How it affected the airline industry</h2>
        <p>As a result of this unfortunate accident, the FAA mandated that lavatories now have smoke detectors and automatic fire extuingishers.
          Planes were then equipped with floor lighting so passengers could find their way to the exit even in dense smoke. 
          Planes built after 1988 are also built to be more resistant to flames thankfully.
